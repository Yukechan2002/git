            <S.AboutDescription>
              <p>
                My name is Yukesh Chandran , I'm a Full stack developer, passionate about designing and coding. My specialty is
                creating user interfaces and functionalities for web
                applications using MERN stack.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started my journey in university with the initial goal of
                studying Systems Analysis and Development. I've always been
                interested in computers and curious about creating web pages.
                So, I decided to combine these two passions and enrolled in
                college to explore the possibilities in the IT field.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The following year, in 2022, I realized I needed to set a clear
                goal. That's when I directed my efforts to improve my skills in
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming to build web applications and
                deepen my learning. That was the starting point for me to become
                a web developer.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                I continue to study and develop personal projects to expand my
                knowledge, focusing on the JavaScript ecosystem for front-end
                development using ReactJS, JavaScript, Next.js, among others.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am always looking for challenges and opportunities to grow
                professionally, and I am excited to contribute to interesting
                and innovative projects in the field of web development.
